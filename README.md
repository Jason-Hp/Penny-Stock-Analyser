Description: In today's fast-paced world, investors, like myself, are always looking for ways to stay be on top and be informed about the latest stock market trends. One way to do this is by using a simple program that I wrote up for thsi final project that can quickly analyze a stock's price and determine whether it is increasing or decreasing. This program, which is written in the PyCharm, utilises the power of Python programming language.The program begins by importing the necessary libraries. For this specific program, we will use the request and beautifulsoup4 library to retrieve real-time stock data by accessing the web using week 9 knowledge, and the playsound library to play a sound when the stock price is increasing.The request and beautifulsoup4 library is a way to access financial market data, thru opening google and using Yahoo Finance, including the current stock prices, and it allows us to retrieve other stock data like opening and closing with ease. The playsound library is a built-in library in pycharm which is specifically used to play sounds and alert sounds.Next, the program establishes a connection to the internet and retrieves the latest stock data for a specified stock using the request library. The stock data is then stored in a variable for further analysis. Using this data, the program then calculates the difference between the current stock price and the stock price from 2-3 minutes ago. This allows us to determine whether the stock price is increasing or decreasing.If the stock price has increased, the program plays a sound using the playsound library. This sound serves as an alert to the user, indicating that the stock price is increasing and they should take notice. However, if the stock price has decreased, the program does not play a sound and simply continues to retrieve and analyze the latest stock data as seen in the code.Additionally, the program can be further enhanced by including features like ability to track multiple stocks and perform actions like sending an email, SMS or even making a trade but am cautious to losses so manual buying would be better in my opinion.One of the main advantages of this program is its simplicity. The program is easy to understand and implement, making it accessible to both experienced investors and those new to the stock market. Additionally, the program is efficient, able to analyze and display stock data in real-time. This means that I can stay informed about the latest stock market trends without having to constantly check for updates.There were many problems I faced during the creation of my final project. One would be how much memory, or RAM, it took up on my computer hence slowing my computer down significantly. I was planning on running this program in the background while doing other stuff, such as playing video games or watching shows/movies. However with the amount of RAM or memory the program takes up, my activities are hindered and sometimes my computer, albeit quite old in age, hangs. So that is one of the key problems I faced while making this program.In conclusion, the program that we have discussed in this explaination is a useful tool for investors like myself looking to stay informed about the latest stock market trends. It is written in the PyCharm development environment, and utilizes the power of Python programming language to quickly analyze a stock's price and determine whether it is increasing or decreasing. The program's relative simplicity, efficiency, and real-time functionality (albeit needs me to click run when the market opens) make it an excellent choice for investors of lower levels such as myself.
